MSBuild.NugetPackageRestore README
==================================

Enhorabuena! MSBuild.NugetPackageRestore is now installed in your project.
An import to MSBuild.NugetPackageRestore.targets has been added to your project, modify that file for further customization.

This software uses Nuget.Core and Nuget.Commandline to install all packages downloaded to your packages folder
by NuGet Package Restore (http://docs.nuget.org/docs/reference/package-restore) and it should be enabled for this package to work.
This task will allow you to Install all content from your packages to your project, including .pp and .transform files,
also there's an option to enable adding Content references to your project file (refer to MSBuild.NugetPackageRestore.targets for more details)


Thank you for using this software!
